    "## Example - cloning from Github\n",
    "\n",
    "To clone the repo of lecture notes for this course, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/mlamoureux/Math651w17.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should now be able to see a new folder in your syzygy account called \"Math651w17\". Inside you will see all the notes for the course that have been produced so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example - updating your files from Github\n",
    "\n",
    "As we add lecture notes to the Github repo, you will want to update your copies. You should use the \"pull\" command as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%bash\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is you are pulling data from the original repo on github (called origin) using the master branch (which is the only branch we have right now.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the unix terminal\n",
    "You don't have to use the magic command %%bash if you prefer direct unix. In the first tree of the Jupyter service, go to the \"New\" menu and select \"Terminal\". This opens a unix terminal that you can do all your unix-y things directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are in the main directory of the repo you are interested in (say the Math651w17 repo). Then type in your relevant git command, like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pushing back up to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've added some files in your local repo, or made changes to existing files, you need to push them back to Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, tell git to add all the files and folders in the repo to the list of things to add\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git add *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, tell git that you are committing the changes (i.e. you really want to finalize these changes\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git commit -m \"Here are my latest changes\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "(You must include a message to the commit, might as well make it informative.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you push the changes to the origin, at the master branch\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "(This command MUST be done from the unix shell, in the terminal, because it will ask you for a user name and password for the repo. In Michael's example, the user name is mlamoureux, and of course he won't tell you his password.)\n"
