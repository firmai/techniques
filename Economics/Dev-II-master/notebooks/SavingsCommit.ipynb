    "Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) for example place individuals into savings groups and then create pressures and social sanctions to help individuals achieve savings goals.  Iterant savings collectors may serve a similar purpose.

In this type of scenario the individual wants to save up to buy say a refrigerator or other household appliance but cannot find the discipline to save up for the item themselves.  A microcredit loan allows them to buy the refrigerator outright and then places them on a strict repayment schedule that commits the individual to putting aside the fraction of weekly income toward the item that they might have otherwise struggled to do on their own. \n",
