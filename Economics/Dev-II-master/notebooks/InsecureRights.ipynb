    "# Causes and consequences of insecure Property Rights to land\n",
    "\n",
    "Insecure property rights to land can affect investement decisions and the nature and efficiency of agrarian production organization by affecting the market for tenancies and land sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between property rights insecurity and investment is not as obvious as it might appear at first.  While it might seem obvious that property rights insecurity (e.g. the possibility of expropriation) could only reduce incentives to invest and trade this is less obvious once you consider that informal investments might be undertaken to strengthen property rights claims in environments where they might be contested. Think of the homesteader or the informal slum dweller who builds a solid foundation for their home, fences what they consider their property, and builds other 'defences' in the hope that this will exclude others and dissuade a would-be-evicter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a rich literature on this topic, including the readings by Besley (1995), de Soto's *Mystery of Capital*, and *The Other Path* books, the survey by Conning and Deb (2008) and many many others.  In time I'll try to find time to fill out this introduction, in the meantime the rest of the notebook focuses on a short synthesis of Conning and Robinson (2007)."

    "## Conning & Robinson (2007): Property Rights and the Political Organization of Agriculture\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified version of Conning and Robinson's 2007 paper in the Journal of Development Economics, a \"general equilibrium model where the organization of agriculture and the political equilibrium determining the security of property rights are jointly determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its present form this notebook focuses primarily on the economic side of the model which demonstrates how insecure property rights to land (e.g. the risk of expropriation) might affect the equilibrium level of land leasing and equilibrium factor prices.  The dull details of the probabilistic voting model that determines the equilibrium political risk of expropriation are left for another time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is another in the family of general equilibrium models of the size distribution of farms that we've already analyzed.  In all cases we have an economy with an agricultural technology that is linear homogenous in farming skill $S$, land $T$ and labor $L$. We showed that even though there was no market for farm management skills (so $S$ is a non-traded asset) efficient resource allocations could be achieved if we had competitive land and labor markets that allowed households to achieve their efficient scale. This model is similar to Lucas' 1978 size distribution of business firms and would explain the size distribution of farms as determined by an underlying distribution of farming skills across households. In this model efficiency of allocation is independent of the initial distribution of factors $S, T,$ and $L$ in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, in addition to the imperfection in the market for non-traded farming skills, we add a distortion to either the market for land or labor, efficiency can no longer be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eswaran and Kotwal 1996 paper on \"Access to Capital and Production Organization\" can be viewed as a variant on this type of benchmark model.  They introduce two simultaneous distortions. They require that supervisory labor be used at increasing cost to supervise any hired labor.  This is loosely analogous to our shutting down the market for farming skill (or supervision) ability.  The second constraint is a distortion in the market for working capital which determines that households with low initial wealth (principally ownership of land) will be constrained in the market for working capital (in our benchmark model we implicitly assumed working capital could always be financed).  The interaction of these two types of distortion determines that allocations cannot be efficient and also the shape of the equilibrium agrarian 'class structure' or occupational choice hiearchy).  Even though in effect all farms have the same farming skill, households with less ownership of land are more likely to be constrained in access to working capital and hence have to drop out of production entirely (to become 'pure laborers') or may be a constrained 'labor-cultivator' who runs a small farm and then sells labor on the market.  In addition households may be constrained or unconstrained 'capitalist' farms that hire other workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conning and Robinson's paper sets itself up against a similar benchmark model, but in a two period world.  In a world with complete security of property rights land and labor markets will allocate land efficiently across farms in agriculture and labor efficiently across farms in agriculture and manufacturing activities in urban areas. The size distribution of farms in agriculture will be efficient and completely determined by the initial distribution of non-traded farming skills.  Land tenancy markets will be efficient and active.  Take the case of all households having the same farming skill. If landlords have relatively large amounts of land they will lease it out to tenants to bring the distribution of operational farm sizes in line with the distribution of farming skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with this benchmark the model asks what would happen if we introduce property rights insecurity in the form of the possibility of a 'land to the tiller' land or tenancy reform. "

Tenancy under the Japanese colonial administration 1919-45 had been a widespread phenomenon as by one measure over 56 percent of farmer households were tenants and 58 percent of farmland was under tenancy in 1939. Although tenant protests demanding lower rents were not uncommon, the Japanese colonial military presence had strictly enforced landlord's property rights. With the Japanese military suddenly gone the eventuality of land reform became a near certainty.  The interesting thing is that the authors document that in the period just prior to this anticipated reform 60 percent of landlords -- mostly the larger ones -- sold their land to tenants via the market at reduced prices before 1950. More than twice as much land was sold by landlords in anticipation of the reform than was eventually transferred directly via the land reform process.\n",
