 __Lecture and reading Notes as Jupyter Notebooks__

The jupyter notebooks can now be run from a Microsoft Azure 
[jupyter notebook server](https://notebooks.azure.com/jhconning/libraries/DevII). 
Create a free account and clone and/or run from the
[notebook folder](https://notebooks.azure.com/jhconning/libraries/DevII/tree/notebooks) 

This is a repository of jupyter notebooks on topics in the
Microeconomics of Development. Most of what you see here were first
developed for a Spring 2016 version of this course. Most are still only
rough notebooks on specific topics, but over time I hope these should
become more numerous and more polished.

Some notebooks offer just simple analytic summaries of interesting
topics or academic papers, while others provide code for simulations
and visualizations of applied theory models
to replicate and extend results. I hope to add a few replications
of empirical
papers as well. Topics are drawn from the fields of trade and growth,
household economics, agrarian production structure and the equilibrium
size distribution of firms, the political economy of property rights,
institutions and policy reform, the theory of contracts and
intermediation (in markets for land, labor and financial services),
as well as papers on targeting, RCTs and program impact evaluation.

In its present form this is much less like a coherent sequential
collection of lecture notes and more like an idiosyncratic collection
of reading notes and materials that complement lecture notes by
inviting you to explore and extend the embedded simulations and
data analyses.

Viewing and interacting with content
----------------------------------------------
Jupyter notebooks opens a world of new ways of creating content including text, math and code for interactive 
simulation and visualization. Jupyter notebooks can also be easily converted to render the content in different ways and
formats.

(NEW!) This content is now mirrored to a [Microsoft Azure Notebook library for this content](https://notebooks.azure.com/jhconning/libraries/DevII).  If you login with a free Microsoft account
you can launch a cloud-based juptyer notebook server that will allow you to
run any of the notebooks interactively.  Alternatively, clone this github
and run them on your own computer.

The following table describes the contents of the notebooks folders and links
to quick static views of the notebook content.

all this content (but sometimes not all repo content converts).
