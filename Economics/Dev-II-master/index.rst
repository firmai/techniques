You can view the notebooks there or clone/download them to run them on a jupyter server on your own
computer (see how `here`_). The github content is also auto-rendeered as (1) a styled but static `webpages`_ and  2)
a `PDF book`_ using Sphinx and the readthedocs service. The github repo is also cloned
to a Microsoft `Azure notebook library`_ where you can run the notebooks on a cloud-based jupyter notebook server.

Some of this is still quite rough/preliminary content.  Over time I'll try to edit and improve.
