# Statistics for Hackers

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/croach/statistics-for-hackers.git/master?filepath=statistics-for-hackers.ipynb)

This is a Jupyter notebook I created while working through Jake VanderPlas's ["Statistics for Hackers"][stats-for-hackers] talk from [PyCon 2016][pycon], the slides from which can be found [here][slides]. I've posted my notebook here because I couldn't find anywhere else online where the code for the talk existed and I thought it might be of use to others working their way through the talk. If, by chance, you've happened upon this repository and you haven't actually seen, or heard of Jake's talk, by all means, do yourself a favor and [go watch it now][stats-for-hackers] as you follow along with this notebook---the talk is fantastic!
