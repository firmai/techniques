# 2018 SIOP Machine Learning Competition Winning Submission Repository #
The 2018 annual Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) conference featured the first-ever machine learning competition. Teams competed for several months with various analytical techniques to predict turnover in a large US company. Winning submissions had to be done in open source and are posted in this repository. A more complete introduction as presented at the conference can be found [here.](ML_Competition_Intro.pdf) 

### Objective ###
* Predict voluntary turnover (who left) vs. who was still active as of December 31, 2014 at Eli Lilly  

### Data ###
* Data for 32,296 Eli Lilly employees active as of December 31, 2009  
* 162 predictor variables (demographics, location, job-related, job performance, etc.)  
* Training set (n = 24,205)  
* Test set (n = 8,091)  
* Evaluation metric: Cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC) statistic.
